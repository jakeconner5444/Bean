A Python library designed to improve python's built-in data-types


This library is designed to improve the power of pythons built-in data-types.
It would'nt look like improving right now because its not fully made current but there a few improvement in python str.

1. New an useful function
2. follows PEP rules, (because str needs to be Str)
